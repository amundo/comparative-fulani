overall layout/functions/structure:

for every english gloss, 
organized by id determined by sorting function toggled (toggled on any of the columns),
display the english gloss in left "gloss column" column
and display the forms corresponding to that gloss id for the following languages:
    all languages for which the value of the checkbox in the aside is true/checked
for each language, make a column to display 
    (that includes a sorting feature)
generate the columns in order 1-6, with each numerical slot corresponding to the languageid that is in that slot in the aside (the sequence may end early if some are not checked(?))
*organized by id determined by sorting function toggled (toggled on any of the columns),


design for the forms:
for each form, display transcription
play button, which has a function to 
play the associated audio file for that form 
from the starting timestamp to the ending timestamp associated with that form

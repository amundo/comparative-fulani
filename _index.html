  <h2>Why this is a good idea…</h2>

  <section>
    <ul style="max-width:50em">
      <li>data  on places like ucla phonetics archive, that australian langs website, etc. are great, but require a lot of
        clickthrough for comparison
        <ul>
          <li>so this gets data and displays it all at once, since the very structure is comparison</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>in some fieldwork there may be a lot of overlap in words elicited, such as work with Swadesh lists, work on
        multiple languages for parallel projects by the same/similar research teams, or work on related languages
        <ul>
          <li>so this automates comparisons between data with functionality to toggle the view of languages</li>
        </ul>
          </li><li>
            audio files from elicitation sessions are often stored in long recordings or, if segmented, stored in individual
            folders and perhaps named inconsistently; navigating back and forth between files is clunky and doesn't allow
            for fast comparison and easy replay
          <ul>
            <li>audio files are associated with each datapoint (word/form) comparison is invited in the structure of the
              comparative lexicon and with user friendly play features
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
      <li>tool is useful for: a language learners, b researchers for their own work, c researchers for others' work
        </li><li>comparative meth</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            because of: a audio component, b comparison by gloss, c accessible gathered information
          </li>
        </ul>
      
    </ul>

Potential problems with audacity audio workflow:
-low decibel threshold picking up too many unwanted items, but high decibel threshold cutting off starts and ends of target clips
    - slow and inaccurate(?) to manually adjust those clips
-some unwanted items getting picked up anyway -- how to delete and exclude, and does this affect the numbering?
